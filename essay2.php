<p> In popular culture, "Frankenstein" has taken on a meaning beyond just a character
in a classic novel. It carries an implication of inhumanity, of science taken too far.
This essay will explore how this word and its implications have been used in discourse
around the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. In my research so far, I have 
noticed that this word is much more often used to refer to athletes and doctors from
Communist countries such as the USSR and East Germany, so the Cold War is also a possible 
context I will be exploring. </p>
